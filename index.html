                I’ve always had a sweet spot for the Animal Crossing series, but I haven’t really 
                realised why - until recently. Back in 2020, during my final years of highschool, 
                getting out of bed and committing to the workload was an overwhelmingly stressful 
                experience, especially at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, this made 
                it even more difficult to make friends or stay in contact with already existing ones 
                (out of the very few existing friends I already had at the time). On top of this, I 
                didn’t really talk to many people to begin with, thanks to my awkward social tendencies. 
                So more often than not, I finished each day feeling pretty demoralised.

            <div class="paragraph mb-16">
                As a natural response, I turned to video games as a form to escape - finding 
                comfort in games like Stardew Valley, Super Mario Galaxy, and most notably, 
                Animal Crossing. Whereas my school days were filled with isolation and even 
                alienation, Animal Crossing felt like a world I could belong in. One where I 
                was in control; one where I could have friends, write them letters and they 
                would write back. Where the time progressed the same as outside and made it 
                feel real. It sounds pretty ridiculous now, but to a depressed teenager, it 
                was a much needed break.

                As a result of my retreatment into Animal Crossing throughout the peak of the 
                pandemic, it was one of the primary games that piqued my interest regarding the 
                topic of escapism in general. Were others doing this? Was this a documented phenomenon? 
                How directly was this linked to my (admittedly faltering) mental health? I had so many 
                mild (yet prominent) questions, and one way to answer them - it was time for research. 
                Not only did this lead me down a rabbit hole of videogame academia, but also has pushed 
                me to connect with fellow video game enthusiasts, discussing their experiences with their 
                favourite games and the idea of residing in their own ‘personal paradise’.

            <h1 class="mb-16 text-4xl font-bold">But what is escapism?</h1>

            <!-- Essay section -->
            <div class="paragraph">
                Interestingly enough, I found that the idea of escapism through digital media, 
                particularly video games, has been the topic of much debate for years - down to the very definition 
                of the word "escapism". For the sake of clarity in my brief delve into the depths of video game 
                psychology, I'll simplify the definition adopted by Andreas Hansen and Yuhui Gan in their paper 
                <a class="underline hover:text-gray-400" href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1699002/FULLTEXT01.pdf">
                An Analysis of The Impact of Escapism on Players</a> - to define escapism as "using video games
                to avoid other aspects of life".
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph mt-16">
                Given that this is a video game blog post and not a peer reviewed paper, I don't want to approach this
                with the academic rigour of one, rather as a brief discussion of the fascinating concepts mentioned in previous research
                that affect every single one of us gamers. One common distinction made in previous research is the difference
                between healthy and unhealthy escapism - which immediately fascinated me, as I felt I had experienced both in 
                my hours upon hours of Animal Crossing. Not only was I playing to amuse myself, enjoy the game, and honestly just 
                boost my mood - but also playing to avoid having to do anything else, as I felt I couldn't really face the world, 
                which to some degree worsened how I felt.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph mt-16 mb-16">
                In Hansen and Gan's paper, they investigate a topic dubbed the "Four Pillars of Healthy Escapism", founded upon 
                emotional regulation, mood management, coping, and recovery. Again the research felt eerily accurate in its parallels
                to my personal experience throughout the height of COVID lockdowns, as they then go on to provide definitions of the concepts 
                in the context of video games. Interestingly it seems that much of the research done into the idea of escapism 
                specifically addresses MMOs for the associated social interaction - but as a more singleplayer focused person 
                that recreation of social interaction hadn't really struck me before, so I'd love to see in the comments if any of 
                you felt this way!

                            SAME! Having to deal with hard times and all the life stresses is too overwhelming. 
                            I am too busy having to deal with heavy workloads, sometimes I find myself socially 
                            isolated. I play PUBG as my harbour to escape from reality. The survival 
                            setting of PUBG and effective collaborating with team mates to defeat enemies made me 
                            feel a sense of belonging in group. Thankfully, through playing video games I’ve also got 
                            to know some good mates, that totally saved me from feeling socially isolated in my real busy life.

                            Maybe I should also try something different. Personally, I also find video game as a 
                            form of escape but also a way of connecting with my children. Me and my son Johnny 
                            play Super Mario Galaxy each weekend as breaks from work. We are fulfilled with the 
                            sense of achievement each time we’ve collected stars and defeated the NPCs together. 
                            I always think of video games like the marshmallow in a cup of coffee, it sweetens and
                             relieves the bitter in reality.

                            I can totally relate! I had just moved before lockdown started, I knew no one around 
                            me and barely spoke in online school. World of Warcraft literally became my sanctuary. 
                            I was so isolated in real life with my old friends being on the other side of the world 
                            in a different time zone and no one new to speak to. I'd play World of Warcraft for 
                            like 3 hours a day. I could finally go on these epic quests and have this genuine sense 
                            of camaraderie with my guild. Soon it was like my social life was bustling with elves, 
                            paladins, and mages. I finally could connect to people, in fact they seemed to be the 
                            only people I could connect to. I no longer had any need for real life social interaction 
                            but when it came time to go back to in person classrooms, I realised I had an interest to 
                            share with people, I was confident enough to talk to strangers easily, after all I had 
                            been doing it for years on WoW! I wish people talked more about how video games can offer 
                            a sense of community and identity, an escape from reality, when needed most instead of just 
                            focusing on addiction or their violent nature. This was such an insightful post!

                    Hello to David, Tom, Enya, or anyone else who may be marking this! We hope
                    you enjoyed our delve into escapism in video games through the facade of a 
                    video game blog post! While the content itself was rather brief, a significant 
                    amount of the thought and effort put into this project was in capturing the 
                    'essence' of a gaming community through this presentation format (heavily inspired 
                    by <a class="underline italic hover:text-gray-400" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-bomberman-r-2-review">this</a> 
                    IGN review) and we hope it came across as such. As a final note I'd like to 
                    thank all of you for a great semester and for the effort you put into this class! - Julian
